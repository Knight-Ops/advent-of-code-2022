# Advent of Code 2022 in Rust

This respository contains the code, input, and benchmarks of each AOC-2022 challenge I have completed. In each day's source folder will be a README of `criterion` benchmarks for each day. Benchmarks are all run on the same machine, but obviously are not that useful for comparing to other solutions directly since hardware will add major variance.
